0.0.3 - fixed collider bug (collider bugged when destroyed)
		fixed destroy bug (child wasn't destroyed)
		fixed negative width problem (scaled sprites return negative width)
		added game.ShowMouse(false); to show/hide mouse
0.0.4 - added sound channel parameter to Sound.Play.
		fixed system from running too fast on systems without vsync
		fixed game.Destroy() to close window.
		
0.0.5  
------
AnimSprite:
	- all fields protected instead of private now
	- updated setUVS to deal with rounding errors which were causing visible tearing when aligning tiles
Canvas:
	- rewritten, now extends Sprite and allows existing images to be passed in, rotation, collision, and setting the origin
Game:
	- now allows listening for before and after update events to allow for manager addition without it having to be a game object.
	- updated rendering mechanism to work with target frame rate and provide target vs real fps
Key:
	- table updated to include more keys and correct key codes
GL:
	- updated with codes for line drawing. 
	- updated with codes for texture repetition
GLContext:
	- POLYGON_SMOOTH disabled to fix diagonal tearing in sprites.
	- GLContext no longer drives the Time class to fix a timing bug concerning framerate and deltatime
	- Turned off VSYNC by default, since it interfered with custom FPS rendering
	- GLContext now takes parameter vsync on startup and handles all timing internally, by default vsync is true
GameObject:
	- now adds itself to the game instance for updates/collisions
	- collision code moved from sprite to gameobject
	- invalidate flag removed
	- TransformPoint rewritten to reuse base class TransformPoint
	- class is now partial
Sprite:
	- Hittest code moved to base class, installed BoxCollider through new mechanism
	- Initialization and collider installing now overridable
	- blendMode property added
CollisionManager/UpdateManager:
	- now handle double additions/removal correctly
Time:
	- updated time class to use glfw timing due to better granularity
Texture2D:
	- enabled wrap property, which allows you to set the texture to repeat mode (subclass of sprite required which modifies the UV's)
BlendMode:
	- added BlendMode class, please send in your awesome blendmode creations to Bram/Hans
MouseHandler:
	- added MouseHandler as a very basic event based interface to the Input.mouseXY/mousedown properties

				
0.0.7 - changed GetKeyDown and GetKeyMouse behaviour to allow for multiple calls pro frame
      - Added sprite Texture cache cleanup
      - Added Pivot class
      - Added GetCollisions method to GameObject
      - Updated game.width, game.height on resize so they should return actual width/height now
      - Added InverseTransformPoint (not tested properly) and DistanceTo
      - Added Mathf lib
      - Renamed AnimSprite -> AnimationSprite
      - GameObject is now an abstract class, use Pivot instead

0.0.8 - Replaced all 'double' properties with floats

0.0.9 - Fixed collision issue around max edges
	Missing keycodes
	White texture issue
0.0.10 - White texture restored
0.0.11 - Texture2D.Dispose returning null error resolved (Canvas.Destroy fix)
	- targetFramerate can't go below 1 to avoid division by zero
	- setScale added to set both scaleX and scaleY at once
	- getMouseUp (thanks LeonB)
	- Sprite.cs width/height getter/setter fixed .. they were using ints
