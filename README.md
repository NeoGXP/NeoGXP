# GXPEngine #

This is the GXPEngine. It's used for learning about game development at Saxion University of Applied Sciences.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone the latest version of the master branch
* Open the "GXPEngine.sln" file to open the project using Visual Studio Community (or whichever IDE you prefer)

### Possible improvements (actively) being worked on ###

* Replace FMOD with something open source/open licensed -> SoLoud
* Make full screen crashes function better

### I have some ideas for new features! Who do I talk to? ###

* Contact any of the Game Programming teachers (check blackboard for an up-to-date list)
* You can implement it yourself (following the coding conventions of course) and create a pull request
