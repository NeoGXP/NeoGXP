This is NeoGXP. NeoGXP is a C# engine for simple 2D game creation.

It has been tested to work on Linux and Windows. (64-bit only)

## History
NeoGXP used to be called GXPEngine, and was used for learning about game development
at Saxion University of Applied Sciences.

It has now been retired as a learning tool, and is being reworked into a more
proper, full-featured engine.

## How do I get set up?
1. Clone the latest version of the master branch
2. Open the "GXPEngine.sln" file to open the project using Rider, Visual Studio or whichever other IDE you prefer

## Possible improvements (actively) being worked on
